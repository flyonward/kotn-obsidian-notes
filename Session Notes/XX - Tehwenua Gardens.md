## Session Summary
The Keystones face off against Nalani and the garden defense forces (giant golems) in the secret courtyard of the Tehwenuwa Gardens. Throughout the battle, more of Nalani's forces join the fight, including a wolf with a scorpion-tail, invisible imps, and a handful of cultists. The Keystones almost dispatch of Nalani before she calls to Glasya for help and disappears for several turns, returning as "Nalani, the Feathered". Given a new form by Glasya, she resembles an Erinyes with the distinct wings but heavily overtaken by plants. Despite her new form, the Keystones are able to make short work of her. After the battle, the Keystones investigate the area. 
**=-=-= Key Findings =-=-=**
a) Whisper Moss that listen in on passerby conversations and gather secrets that they hear
b) Books and logs that tell of Glasya's desire to disrupt Asmodeus' hold on the Wound and to claim the Wound for herself
c) An inscribed circle is made of an entwinement of Abyssal and Infernal, languages associated with demons and devils. The circle can be used to communicate with and to summon creatures from both the demon-plane and the devil-plane, so long as the appropriate offering is placed on the offering pedestal.

## Last Session Recap
Party is on Honu'ele, giant turtle. Maramara village
escorted by warrior tortle, follower of Helm towards Aorangi Summit (peak of tortle island)
Also with Kaius? Or no
Avoided stampeded of Brambleboars
Found eviscerated tortle remains hung high above, dripping/raining blood along the path we take (yo r u kidding me)

Tehwenuwa Gardens that we were supposed to find on the way to the Aorangi Summit

We have reached the Gardens and meet tiefling Zara. She wanted to learn more about her family because her and her family has been on the island since the beginning of the island (where everyone was supposed to have been born as tortles), but her family were born as tieflings instead

Within the Gardens, Party invades a secret area of the Garden that we were not supposed to have gained access to. Place was run by devil-worshipping cultists; cult of Glasya
- have several hidden levels, place is a front for gambling and other less-than-honorable deeds

Happen upon Elf: Nalani, caretaker of this secret portion of the Gardens. Nalani suspects that the Party were the ones who first invaded this part of the Gardens, but Party was able to deceive Nalani (at least for now).

Battle breaks out as Nalani finds out we are the actual intruders.
Caine, Beltane, Saf, and Baeldarr is inside the house to face against Nalani.
Pitch casts forcecage on Zara, himself, and Obu as protection against the 2 giant golem constructs that are focused on Zara.


## Detailed Log / Moment-To-Moments
A wolf with scorpion-tail enters the battle. Saf is sure that this creature is the one that did the strung up the bloody, eviscerated bodies along the treetops. Caine finishes the wolf and it dissolves into a puddle of abyssal goo before burning up in smoke.

Nalani summons 2 devil-plants from 2 pots sitting beside her

Aria casts Banish on one of the golems: *poof* it is gone
Nalani is hurt very badly and casts a spell to leave the battle

Nalani returns to the battle through the statue of Glasya, transforming into a humanoid plant-like being with wings, returning as Nalani the Feathered. Nalani looks ike a nasty plant phoenix

Caine slays Nalani the Feathered with a crit! rolling 120 damage

> Battle is over

Commotion outside the Gardens, with people saying "how can they break in?!"
Strange moss seems to be growing and moving from the collapsed stonearch near Zara. 
As Nalani dies, plants all around the secret garden reverts to more that with more limb-like features as Nalani is no longer there as the anchor for the magic. 

The moss from the stone arches whisper upon investigation by Beltane. Zara recognize the moss as Whisper Moss which tell secrets long lost to time. Zara regards the Moss as almost a fabled organism, something thought long lost and from a legend. Obu tries to ask the Moss what happened to Lathander during the Times of Trouble, but their answer was not one that made sense. Aria asks the Moss what their name is, but she gets multiple responses back (from a cluster of Moss). 
- Zara: The Moss listens and gathers secrets they hear - why was the Moss kept here? Doesn't it seem cruel to keep the Moss here?

From the basement team's investigation:
- Glasya has a specific interest here on the tortle island
- Books that mention revealing the wound, opening the wound --> Lathander's wound?

Talla Shellstriker rushes in to confirm whether Keystones are actually in the secret garden. 

Pitch scrapes some Moss and tries to read the memories of the Moss. Instead of a sequential timeline of events, Pitch receives rapid-fire snippet collection of memories, like 3-5 seconds of 200 different shows. 
> An how long will be here? Until the wound is ruptured

> Nalani: it doesn't matter who he is, our mistress (Glasya?) will be the one to claim the wound

> A last series of different screams and shouts - "what was that?!", like an overheard chatter of something big that had happened but not able to get a clear, full picture of what happened

This Moss creature appears to be a remnant of some sort of magical disaster - very likely caused by The Event (the event that caused the island-wide birth of tortles)
\*\*Zara also mention that there are also other creatures that interact with memory -> another thread to follow-up on

Nalani kept a moss-diary/log: Nalani turned Zara away because she could disrupt Glasya's plans. involving Zara's father (Asmodeus) and the Wound

Inscribed circle in the basement: has elements of 2 different langauges.
Obu touches the non-chaotic-looking scripts: describes Melbok and Glasya and has connection to Glasya's realm and can be used to call inferno creatures into the current realm
Glasya says we have aligned interests, that both want to crack open the wound. Asmodeus has a hold on the wound and Glasya wants to disrupt/put an end to that. 
- they speak of a secret entrance hidden at the highest peaks of Aorangi Summit. Mighty guardians guard the entrance to that place. The Festering Wound in the infernal heart of this place that Asmodeus has a hold of.

Obu also touches the Abyssal scripts and reveals connection to Tenebrous, the other name of demon lord Orcas. 

The circles can be used to communicate with and to summon creatures from both the demon-plane and devil-plane, if the appropriate offering is placed on the offering pedestal.
- Devils and demons are at war with each other, so why is there a circle that can summon/connect to both? What is the common denominator that pits them together - perhaps along the lines of "enemy of my enemy"?
