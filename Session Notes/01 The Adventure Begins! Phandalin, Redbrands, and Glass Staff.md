## Summary
The Party ([[Caine]], [[Pitch]], [[Yue]], [[Safaerys]], and [[Beltane]]) are hired by [[Gundren]] and [[Sildar Hallwinter|Sildar]] to escort a caravan to [[Barthen's Provisions]] in [[Phandalin]]. After being ambushed by goblins, the Party found drag marks leading north to a secret path, eventually leading to a cavern. In the cavern, the Party battled goblins and a bugbear. After the battle in the cavern, the Party finds barrels marked with a blue lion, identified as the emblem of [[Lionshield Coster]]. The Party also found and rescued [[Sildar Hallwinter|Sildar]] in the cave, at which point he explained Gundren's story:

>[!info]- Gundren's Story
>Gundren and his brothers, Tharden and Nundro, found the entrance to [[Wave Echo Cave]]. 500 years ago, a pact was made between Dwarves and Gnomes to create the [[Forge of Spells]], which is said to be able to create magic artifacts. The [[Forge of Spells]] was later seized by orcs, who then destroyed [[Phandalin]] and the entrance to [[Wave Echo Cave]].

The Party also learns that [[Iarno]], Sildar's wizard contact in Phandalin, had gone missing and that Gundren had been taken to [[Cragmaw Castle]] in Phandalin.

The Party heads to Phandalin to complete the caravan escort at Barthen's Provisions. Through conversation with various people, the Party learns that:
> [!important]+ Key Info
> - [[Redbrands]], a group of ruffian vigilantes, settled into Phandalin 2 months ago - the same time as when [[Iarno]] disappeared
> - Redbrands are using [[Tresendar Manor]] as their hideout

Safaerys meets with [[Halia Thornton]] and joins [[Zhentarim]] as an agent.

The Party moves in on [[Tresendar Manor]] to pursue the [[Redbrands]]. Through their advances and investigation, they find **Talon**, a hand axe that belonged to a knight of the Tresendar family. The Party also glean that:
> [!important]+ Key Info
> - [[Redbrands]] are hired by someone by the name of "[[Iarno|Glass Staff]]"
> - [[Iarno|Glass Staff]] is a magic user who is hired by [[The Black Spider]]

The Party finds [[Droop]], a malnourished and beaten goblin who was kept as a pet by the [[Redbrands]]. Caine elects to keep and protect [[Droop]]. 

The Party finds a dungeon holding 3 prisoners, who reveal themselves to be the family of Thel Dendrar: Mirna (wife), Nilsa (daughter), and Nars (son). Mirna and her family were from [[Thundertree]] and ran an herb and alchemy store, but they fled their home from an insurgence of undead. Mirna tells of a family heirloom that is still left inside the family-run store. Pitch, Beltane, and Yue escort the family out of the underground to safety.

Behind the final doors of [[Tresendar Manor]], the Party finds [[Iarno|Glass Staff]] After his defeat in battle, he reveals himself to be [[Iarno]] and that he is working for [[The Black Spider]], a drow, in exchange for information about the [[Forge of Spells]]. 

In celebration of the Party's victory over [[Iarno|Glass Staff]], [[Sleeping Giant]] is rebranded as "Heroes of Phandalin Inn".
