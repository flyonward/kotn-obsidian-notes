- [[Urlam Stockspool]], an important member of [[Zhentarim]]
- [[Darathra Shendrel]], leader of [[Triboar]]
### Giant Castle on a Cloud
The Party meets with [[Zephyros]] in his home, the [[Giant Castle On A Cloud]]. [[Zephyros]] speaks of a prophecy of destruction and chaos, the Party agrees to travel to [[Triboar]] on the Castle Cloud. The Party also obtains some information about Giants and their societal system:

> [!info]+ The Caste System of Giants, as defined by the Ordning
> Giants follow a hierarchical system, in descending order:
> 1. Annam, the All-Father (a god)
> 2. Storm Giants
> 3. Cloud Giants
> 4. Fire Giants, known to be volatile and warmongers
> 5. Frost Giants, known to be predatory and for thheir partial prowess
> 6. Stone Giants, known to be xenophobic
> 7. Hill Giants, widely known as gluttonous dullards

> [!info]+ Additional Info on Giants
> - Giants are widely regarded as enemies of dragons
> - Mortals stopped the rise of the dragon queen
> - The caste system was shattered, leading to giants at war with one another as they compete for the top spot
> - The last great giant empire was Ostoria

### Triboar
The Party arrives in [[Triboar]], a large bustling mercantile town. Beltane notes of an untouched forest outside of town named [[Gwaeron's Slumber]]. It is said that worshippers of Gwaeron, God of Tracking, or Mieliki, Goddess of the Forest, would receive prophetic dreams if they slept there. For the night, [[Yue]] , Pitch, and Caine head to [[Six Windows]] while Beltane and Safaerys camp out in [[Gwaeron's Slumber]] in hopes to receive some prophetic dreams. 

#### Gwaeron's Slumber-(Party)
Beltane and Safaerys share information about their parents with each other, eating some pastries and sweetwater before falling asleep. In the middle of the night, Beltane is awoken and attacked by an **Oni**. Beltane barely makes it by the skin of her teeth, but she and Safaerys manage to chase off the oni, causing it to flee to the hills.
#### Six Windows
Meanwhile, Caine investigates [[Six Windows]] and discovers [[Tolmara Hysstryn]] spying on him. Caine sneaks into her room after she falls asleep and lifts a key from her neck. The key unlocks the attic, and Caine finds the skeletal remains of Tolmara's husband hidden in the attic.
### The Siege of Triboar
In the morning, the Party wakes up to a large army of giants, orcs, magmen, and orogs sieging the town. The invaders are equipped with several catapults and are destroying buildings with boulders. The army is led by two fire giants, [[Okssort]] and [[Ildman]]. The Party is joined by members of the town willing to defend their land.

After the dust settles, [[Darathra Shendrel]] invites the Party to the [[Lord Protector's Tower]] where townsfolk offer work to the Party. [[Darathra Shendrel|Darathra]] wishes the Party to investigate the fire giants' motives and shows the Party a large rod - known as [[Rod of Vonindod]]. 

> [!example] Possible Quests
> - Pursue a wanted brigand named "Weevil". Deliver him to [[Mirabar]] for 5,000G
> - Pay a visit to [[Harthos Zymorven]], [[Urgala Meltimer]]'s traveling companion, who has a giant-slayer greatsword. He currently lives in [[Silverymoon]].
> - Head to [[Everlund]] and speak with [[Dral Thelev]] about the [[Rod of Vonindod]]
> - Visit [[Silverymoon]] and speak with the Margaster family. [[Othovir]] is their kin and the Margaster family has a stash of magical items
> - Deliver a caravan to [[Noanar's Hold]]

#### Gwaeron's Slumber (pt. 2)
Upon hearing Beltane's and Safaerys' encounter with the **oni**, the Party decide to pay it another visit (spoiler alert: the Oni didn't live).
#### Triboar
Back in Triboar, the Party collects a cart and horse named Boris from Narth. Safaerys also purchases her own horse. Once all's been settled in Triboar, the Party sets their sights on [[Yartar]]. 
### Yartar
Upon arriving at [[Yartar]], an industrial riverport, the Party receives the appropriate permit to travel through the town for the day. At nightfall, the Party camps just outside of town. 

In the morning, the Party is approached by a figure on horseback. He reveals himself to be [[Udomorn]], a scholarly dragonborn studying giants. [[Udomorn]] is in need of an escort to the town of [[Calling Horns]] and wishes to further investigate troll activity in the [[Evermoors]]. The Party agrees to help in escorting [[Udomorn]].

Caine notices a crumbling tower to the north and the Party investigates. The tower was sealed off by a boulder and sounds of a wailing creature can be heard from within. [[Yue]] wants to call out to the creature and [[Udomorn]] identifies the language as Giant. [[Udomorn]] yells out in Giant in hopes of communication while the rest of the Party advances. Caine sends Gray to peer through the tower windows, finding a female hill giant sitting inside who begins to sing a mournful dirge. Just as [[Yue]] and [[Udomorn]] devise a plan to move the boulder, the female giant stops singing and shoves the boulder out of the way, ready to fight.
<< after the battle >>
As the giant breathes her last, she whispers about her husband [[Hruk]]. Out of sympathy, [[Yue]] revives her. Thankfully, the giant does not seem to remember the fight with the Party and her death in battle. She divulges:
> [!info] Info from Hill Giant, Moog
> - The female hill giant is named [[Moog]]
> - Her husband, [[Hruk]], was forced by the tribe leader [[Guh]] to [[Grudd Haug]]

The Part agrees to help [[Moog]]... later. But for now, they trek on towards [[Calling Horns]].
### Calling Horns
What was once a small roadside inn, [[Calling Horns]] is now a small settlement after it was purchased and expanded upon by its owner, [[Tamalin Zoar]]. The Party heads into the original inn ([[Calling Horns Inn]]) and is greeted by a blonde halfling woman - but before she can even speak, [[Udomorn]] requests an audience with [[Tamalin Zoar|Tamalin]] immediately. The halfling warns that [[Tamalin Zoar|Tamalin]] is eating dinner and does not like to be disturbed, but despite her warnings, [[Udomorn]] will not be stopped. Eventually, [[Udomorn]] convinces the woman to take the Party to her. Naturally, Tamalin is displeased at the intrusion but reports that there have been attacks in the outlying farms and that farmers' livestock are being killed. If the Party decide to resolve the problem, Tamalin would prefer not to pay in gold but rather write a *letter of recommendation* to either:
- A friend in [[Everlund]], or
- The [[Hands of Yartar]], which Caine identifies as the Thieves' Guild

Before the sun rises, the Party is abruptly awoken by the sounds of screaming horses. Beltane dashes out of her room and heads towards the stables, wildshaping into a sabretooth tiger on the way; Caine sees from his window that something had broken through the stable walls.
<small><sub><sup>Editor's notes: pajama fun facts - Caine sleeps in Iarno's spare clothes, Beltane sleeps in her travel clothes and not her armor, Yue sleeps in silk pajamas, and Pitch sleeps in his pants.</sup></sub></small>
Equipped with the keen nose of a sabretooth tiger, Beltane catches the sent of trolls emanating from within. Rounding the corner, Beltane spots a pair of trolls beyond the broken walls and leaps into action, the rest of the Party following behind. Through their encounter, the Party learns that trolls have high regenerative capabilities, rendering them essentially immortal unless killed by fire or acid. Still, the Party emerges triumphant, bringing a semblance of peace to [[Calling Horns]]. [[Tamalin Zoar|Tamalin]] thanks the party for defending her town. <small><sub><sup>Editor's notes: will Tamalin reward the Party with the letter of recommendation that she promised? Find out next time!</sup></sub></small>

After completing the escort of [[Udomorn]] to [[Calling Horns]], the Party decides against immediately heading into the [[Evermoors]], first stopping by [[Noanar's Hold]] to deliver their cargo. The Party also convinced [[Udomorn]] to tag along as well.
### Noanar's Hold
[[Noanar's Hold]] is a small, spooky village with rattled folk and a shuttered keep that stands on a hill overlooking the village. The Party delivers the cargo to the groundskeeper of the Keep, who accepted the package but promptly shoo'd them off. Later that night, the Party heads to the [[White Hart Inn]] in search of respite from traveling. Opening the doors to the inn, they are met with a scene most peculiar - while patrons are seated at tables, chatting and dining as one would expect, a plethora of plates, glasses, mugs, and cutlery float about in the air moving throughout the inn on their own. The innkeeper catches their surprise and explain that the inn is ran with an army of permanently-summoned **Unseen Servants**. The innkeeper also warns the group from travelling at night; there are rumors of a group of undead hunters who prey on those from outside [[Noanar's Hold]]. The group also meet three noble brothers from [[Neverwinter]] who are planning to embark on an expedition to hunt a hill giant the next morning.

Of course, as is customary in any D&D campaign, the Party does nothing with any of these obvious plot hooks and instead departs for the [[Evermoors]] before dawn of the next day. 
### Evermoors
The [[Evermoors]] is an area comprised of hills, troughs, chilly bogs, and swamps. There is a dense fog that permeates throughout the area and frequent gusts of wind. While the prevalent swamps usually make travelling rather difficult, [[Safaerys]]' affinity and familiarity with swamplands allow the group to navigate with ease. The Party quickly found troll tracks and, while following these tracks, stumble upon the lair of a **black dragon**. Within, they discover the skeletal remains of a large dragon and an empty alcove - presumably where the dragon used to stash its hoard. During their investigation, dragon eggs begin to hatch, revealing wyrmlings and locking the Party into battle! After their successful battle against the wyrmlings, [[Safaerys]] and [[Caine]] are telepathically lured towards two hidden abominations called **Otyughs**. Luckily, the group spot the ambush and are able to defeat the horrible creatures.

Venturing deeper into the lair, the Party finds a fire giant holding what looks to be a [[Rod of Vonindod]]. Accompanying the fire giant is a troll, collared and on a leash - a pet? The group tries to avoid catching the attention of the giant by using Safaerys' `Pass Without a Trace`, but they are still spotted. Despite suffering considerable damage and Caine nearly falling in battle, the Party defeats the giant and her pet troll and clutches onto victory. From the giant, the group loots a sack of random items including a pig named [[Not Food]]. [[Not Food]] takes a liking to Caine.
### Calling Horns
Back at [[Calling Horns]], the Party meets with [[Tamalin Zoar]] and advises of the presence of fire giants in the [[Evermoors]], the [[Rod of Vonindod]], and the giants' search for adamantium constructs. [[Tamalin Zoar|Tamalin]] writes them a *letter of recommendation* to her friend in Everlund, [[Dral Thelev]] - the same person that [[Darathra Shendrel]], leader of [[Triboar]], urged the group to seek out in regards to the [[Rod of Vonindod]].
